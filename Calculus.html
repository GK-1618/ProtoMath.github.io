  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">In contrast with algebra and geometry, the discovery of ideas in calculus has been somewhat spread across history, with the formalization of the subject being viewed as its first point of origin. It can be difficult to concretely define if a problem is inherently based in Calculus or not, potentially even moreso than other subjects of mathematics. For example, the Egyptian mathematician Moscow Papyrus determined a formula for the volume of a pyramid around 1800 BC (namely, \(V=\frac{1}{3}bh\), where \(b\) is the area of the base and \(h\) is the height). While such a problem might seem to be purely geometrical in nature, the derivation given by Papyrus involved dissecting the pyramid into a large number of small rectangular prisms to give a finer and finer approximation for the volume. This, though, corresponds to the main idea of integration in calculus, but applied for the specific problem of finding a volume. A similar occurrence happened with Archimedes, who determined the volume of a sphere to be \(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) using the same idea. </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">However, mathematics conventionally tends to only regard a subject as being developed when the tools that are created apply to a set of general circumstances. This is part of why the formalization of calculus is generally thought of as the true beginnings of the subject: before then, techniques such as the aforementioned one couldn't be used for arbitrary objects. As an example, a general formula could not be derived for the surface area of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> without a formally given definition of integration.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In addition to ambiguity regarding the subject's construction, the development of calculus would also raise issues regarding the rigorous foundations of the subject. Specifically, the establishment of the subject itself was largely spurred in the 17th century by two main scholarly figures: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1). In Newton's case, one of the main motivating questions he considered that led to his work on calculus was whether or not there was a general series expansion of \((1+x)^{\alpha}\) for any real number \(\alpha\). Newton understood that such an expansion clearly existed in the case that \(\alpha\) was a positive integer due to the binomial theorem, but was hoping to extend it to working for other real numbers \(\alpha\). By considering this question and taking certain intuitive properties for granted, Newton touched upon the idea of infinite series expansions, which in turn led to his consideration of other related ideas such as convergence and vector fields.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In contrast with Newton, though, Leibniz focused on building calculus up from rigorous foundations, differing from Newton's approach of involving physical interpretation. While he wasn't completely successful in giving a flawless axiomatic representation, he did provide a foundation for it that was very useful in corroborating various results of the field.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    As both Newton and Leibniz made publications regarding their work on calculus around the same time, there is some controversy that existed in declaring which of them was the 'true' founder of the subject. At the time the prevailing view in the British mathematics community was that Newton was who should be attributed credit, but both mathematicians are generally regarded as cofounders of the subject in the present day, with Leibniz's notation largely being carried over into settings of modern mathematics.
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Common Criticisms of its Presentation as a Subject</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    By the time many students take calculus, the usefulness of the subject can be relatively apparent without additional focus on its applications, mainly due to the practical formulation of presented problems. One such example might be the classic tank mixture problem, in which a student is tasked with determining the concentration of salt in a tank given some conditions on the inflow and outflow. Moreover, the usage of calculus in physics can also provide the indication that calculus is a widely applied tool in solving an abundance of different types of problems. But although the diverse uses of calculus can be a motivating factor for some students, it can also give the impression that the subject is extremely vast, and that it is in turn particularly difficult to learn well.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    While this perspective may be a bit too pessimistic, it does carry a valid point in that it is generally agreed upon that calculus is among one of the tougher mathematics courses to take in high school, especially if students are rushed into the curriculum (5). As articulated by Kevin Knudson, a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Florida, "The end result is a group of students who have 'succeeded' in high school calculus without really having the proper foundations, a tower built on sand.", in that their understanding may be non-holistic and especially dependent on having been taught to solve specific types of problems (2).  
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  Even though most schools have precalculus embedded into the mathematics track before a student takes calculus, it is very important that students are able to actively interweave their precalculus knowledge with their learning in calculus in order to have success in the class (3). This references one of the core difficulties that students have with calculus: that it is much less self-contained than other subjects of mathematics taught in school.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    An analogy could be made with a student that is first learning how to type. Typically, the first thing that is taught to them is how they should position their hands, and they are subsequently shown which letters are supposed to be typed by which hand. In theory, once these two principles are shown to them, typing should become a relatively straightforward task; after all, most proficient typers don't require any additional techniques to type well. Yet, there can be a bit of a gap between when the student is introduced to this information and when they do become proficient at typing, simply because they haven't had enough experience with typing certain words. Much in the same way, a student may 'know' algebra and geometry, but doing well in calculus requires that they have an intuitive grasp of what contexts they can be applied in and how to do so.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    One solution to this could involve placing a greater emphasis on broader conceptual understanding of each topic, rather than providing solution layouts that are copied in solving problems. While the latter approach might be directed to yield results on a test such as the AP exam, the former often helps to motivate how solutions to problems are structured, which leads to a more fluid comprehension of both subject matters and the ideas that are applied in more general problem settings.
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Formality in Mathematics</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    A common trope seen in introductory mathematics classes is the student that questions "Why do I need to show my work?". It may be because they got the correct answer as given by the answer key and felt that it should be evident that their thought process was correct, or it could be a genuine inquiry about the purpose of showing work in mathematics.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    This often stems from the solutions to problems in earlier math classes seeming somewhat self-evident or obvious. A student might view finding \(n\) such that \(2^n=8\) to be a trivial task - of course the answer is \(n=3\), they may opine. As alluded to earlier, though, mathematical justification in more general circumstances can be crucial to verifying one's intuitive inclinations. Even some of the world's most accomplished mathematicians can make intuitive misjudgements. Take for instance Andrew Wiles, who was awarded the Fields Medal for solving Fermat's Last Theorem by proving the modularity conjecture, in a proof that extended well over a hundred pages. In Wiles's initial publication of his proof of the conjecture in 1993, there was actually a somewhat significant gap which he only recognized when the proof was scrutinized under a formal review process.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In a similar vein, one of the most distinct components of calculus compared to some lower-level mathematics courses is the implicit standard  of rigorous proof that is applied to the subject. While geometry carries some similarities in this respect, in that a high level of detail is generally emphasized, the foundations of calculus certainly require more care due to the higher tendency of making false assumptions. One example could be assuming that any continuous function on, say, the interval \((0,1)\) must be bounded. It seems like a relatively plausible statement, and the same statement would in fact be true were the function defined over the interval \([0,1]\) due to a property known as compactness. However, one can check that the statement is false for the function \(f(x)=1/x\) defined over the given interval.      
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    Another assumption, which is more prevalent among students that aren't fully acquainted with certain formal definitions utilized in calculus, is that any continuous function must be differentiable. Some students may be able to identify the counterexample of a function like \(f(x)=|x|\) which is not differentiable at \(x=0\), but might still assume that a continuous function should be differentiable 'almost everywhere'.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    The intuitive reasoning behind such an assertion might go as follows: a continuous function can be drawn with a pencil without lifting one's hand above the paper, and you couldn't possibly create an infinite abundance of 'sharp turns' in such a manner. This line of reasoning, at first glance, seems to have no real flaws in terms of making incorrect assumptions. However, the main issue is that defining a continuous function as 'one that could be drawn without lifting one's hand' is imprecise. It's a perfectly understandable misconception to think that the previous definition should be relatively concrete - it generally agrees with how a continuous function should act. But with the formal mathematical epsilon-delta definition of a continuous function, the 'hand' can make these sharp turns, perhaps surprisingly, at <em>any</em> point in the curve. One construction of such a function is known is the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeierstrassFunction.html">Weierstrass function</a>.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In this way, one of the most powerful lessons that can be taught in calculus is that of conveying the ways in which our intuition isn't infalliable while demonstrating how we can use mathematical rigour to improve our intuition in a manner that encourages critical thinking. In particular, it is important that calculus is not taught in a style that solely prepares students to answer a specific format of question. This links back to the value of asking natural questions, which is that it allows for such consideration of different facets of mathematics.
