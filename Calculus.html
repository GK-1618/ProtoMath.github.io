  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">In contrast with algebra and geometry, the discovery of ideas in calculus has been somewhat spread across history, with the formalization of the subject being viewed as its first point of origin. It can be difficult to concretely define if a problem is inherently based in Calculus or not, potentially even moreso than other subjects of mathematics. For example, the Egyptian mathematician Moscow Papyrus determined a formula for the volume of a pyramid around 1800 BC (namely, \(V=\frac{1}{3}bh\), where \(b\) is the area of the base and \(h\) is the height). While such a problem might seem to be purely geometrical in nature, the derivation given by Papyrus involved dissecting the pyramid into a large number of small rectangular prisms to give a finer and finer approximation for the volume. This, though, corresponds to the main idea of integration in calculus, but applied for the specific problem of finding a volume. A similar occurrence happened with Archimedes, who determined the volume for a sphere to be \(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) using the same idea. </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">However, mathematics tends to only regard a subject as being developed when the tools that are created apply to a set of general circumstances. This is part of why the formalization of calculus is generally thought of as the true beginnings of the subject: before then, techniques such as the aforementioned one couldn't be used for arbitrary objects. As an example, a general formula could not be derived for the surface area of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> without a formally given definition of integration.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In addition to ambiguity regarding the subject's construction, the development of calculus would also raise issues regarding the rigorous foundations of the subject. Specifically, the establishment of the subject itself was largely spurred in the 17th century by two main scholarly figures: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1). In Newton's case, one of the main motivating questions he considered that led to his work on calculus was whether or not there was a general series expansion of \((1+x)^{\alpha}\) for any real number \(\alpha\). Newton understood that such an expansion clearly existed in the case that \(\alpha\) was a positive integer due to the binomial theorem, but was hoping to extend it to working for other real numbers \(\alpha\). By considering this question and taking certain intuitive properties for granted, Newton touched upon the idea of infinite series expansions, which in turn led to his consideration of other related ideas such as convergence and vector fields.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In contrast with Newton, though, Leibniz focused on building calculus up from rigorous foundations, differing from Newton's approach of involving physical interpretation. While he wasn't completely successful in giving a flawless axiomatic representation, he did provide a foundation for it that was very useful in corroborating various results of the field.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    As both Newton and Leibniz made publications regarding their work on calculus around the same time, there is some controversy that existed in declaring which of them was the 'true' founder of the subject. At the time the prevailing view in the British mathematics community was that Newton was who should be attributed credit, but both mathematicians are generally regarded as cofounders of the subject in the present day, with Leibniz's notation largely being carried over into settings of modern mathematics.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Common Criticisms of its Presentation as a Subject</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    By the time many students take calculus, the usefulness of the subject can be relatively apparent without additional focus on its applications, mainly due to the practical formulation of presented problems. One such example might be the classic tank mixture problem, in which a student is tasked with determining the concentration of salt in a tank given some conditions on inflow and outflow. Moreover, the usage of calculus in physics can also provide the indication that calculus is a widely applied tool in solving an abundance of different types of problems. But although the diverse uses of calculus can be a motivating factor for some students, it can also give the impression that the subject is extremely vast, and that it is in turn particularly difficult to learn well.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    And while this perspective may be a bit too pessimistic, it does carry a valid point in that it is generally agreed upon that calculus is among one of the tougher courses to take in high school, especially if students are rushed into the curriculum. As articulated by Kevin Knudson, a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Florida, "The end result is a group of students who have 'succeeded' in high school calculus without really having the proper foundations, a tower built on sand." (2). Even though most schools have precalculus embedded into the mathematics track before a student takes calculus, it is very important that students are able to actively interweave their precalculus knowledge with their learning in calculus in order to have success in the class (3). This references one of the core difficulties that students with calculus: that it is much less self-contained than other subjects of mathematics taught in school.
