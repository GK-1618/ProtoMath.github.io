  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">As mentioned previously, one way in which the learning environment of mathematics can be reengineered to emphasize creativity and innovation is by having students explore natural questions that enable their curiosity. In this section, we give examples of such questions that teachers can have their students consider to help spark the sense of wonder, a pedagogy that has been shown to be particularly effective in motivating learning in mathematics (1).</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Algebra</h3>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 We know a formula for solving linear and quadratic equations. Is there an analogous formula for solving cubic equations? What about all higher-order equations?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 Many word problems ask for the final position of a runner given that they have a constant velocity. What happens if their velocity is a function of time \(t\)?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 Are all real numbers the root of some polynomial? What about if the coefficients of each term are all integers?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 Can we generalize the FOIL method to more than two variables?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 You may know the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers to be \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Can you derive a formula for the sum of the first \(n\) squares? What about for the first \(n\) powers of any positive integer? Do you notice anything about how fast these sums grow?
</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Geometry</h3>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 The parallel postulate asserts that Euclidean geometry satisfies the property that any two parallel lines (lines that can be shifted to become identical) do not intersect at any point. Can you come up with a different geometry that does not satisfy this property? 
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">&#9642 Imagine you are given the coordinates of three points in Euclidean space, \((x_1,y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\) that are the vertices of a triangle. Can you come up with a formula for the area of that triangle? What about if more points were given to determine a polygon - can you come up with a formula for the area of the polygon in terms of the coordinates?</p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">&#9642 You might have encountered the trignometric identity \(\cos(2\theta)=2\cos^2\theta-1\), which is known as the double-angle formula (for cosine). Can you express \(\cos(3\theta)\) in terms of \(\cos\theta\)? What about \(\cos(4\theta)\)? What about for \(\cos(n\theta)\) for any positive integer \(n\)? Can this be done with \(\sin(n\theta)\) as well?</p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 Consider some of the important points of a triangle, such as the incenter, orthocenter, circumcenter, and centroid. Can you find any relations between these points, such as lying on a common circle or being collinear?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 You might recall that the area of a circle is given by \(\pi r^2\), which is often proven by dissecting the circle into small triangles. Can you find a formula for the volume of a sphere with a similar approach? 
  </p>

  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642  One of the most used concepts in Calculus is the derivative, which can be taken an arbitrary integer number of times. For example, the function \(f(x)=x^2\) can be differentiated twice to obtain \(f''(x)=2\). This can be done in reverse as well: the \(-1\)st derivative can be though of as being the integral. Is there a way to generalize the \(n\)th derivative of a function \(f\) not just to all integers \(n\), but also to all real numbers?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 Although the derivative 
    \[f'(x)=\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\varepsilon)-f(x)}{\varepsilon}\]
  is designed to work only for \(\varepsilon\rightarrow 0\), what happens if we define a 'discrete derivative' in which \(\epsilon\) is fixed to be \(1\) (so \(f^{*}(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)\) would be the new derivative)? Is it still additive? What happens if you apply this on polynomials? If you keep taking the discrete derivative until the polynomial is constant, what number do you get?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 While the integral is defined by a limit sum across a range of values on the real line, can an analogue of the integral be defined to work not only on the real line but also across any path? Are there multiple ways in which you could get this to work?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 What is the Taylor Series of the function \(f(x)=(1+x)^n\) for any given positive integer \(n\)? How does this expansion connect to the binomial theorem? Can you use this approach to get a 'generalized binomial theorem' that also works for when \(n\) is an arbitrary real number?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    &#9642 Back in Geometry, you may have noticed that the form for the volume of a sphere, which is given by \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), is somewhat similar to the formula \(4\pi r^2\) for its surface area. In fact, the latter formula is the derivative of the former with respect to \(r\)! Does this hold true in general? If so, why?
