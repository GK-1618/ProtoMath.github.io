  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Usually the first form of symbolic mathematics that students are introduced to, algebra is a fundamental tool used within mathematics even today. While it is debated when algebra became a fully developed branch of mathematics, its origins can be traced back to Babylonian civilization. Although the techniques and specific formalisms used vary from their modern counterparts, the core ideas tend to remain the same. For example, the Babylonians considered quadratic equations, one of the most infamous paradigms of high school algebra (1).</p>

  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">As you may know, the quadratic equation refers to the equation</p>
  \[ax^2+bx+c=0.\]

  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">While the Babylonians didn't write the equation precisely in this form, they did state it in a verbal manner. In particular, the reason that we consider such Babylonian mathematics to be akin to algebra is because it leverages the use of the unknown. For example, one could state that they had two bags of apples along with one apple in their hand, which in total constitute nine apples. Despite the verboseness, this is completely equivalent to considering (and solving) the equation</p>
  \[2x+1=9\\
  \Longleftrightarrow 2x=8\\
  \Longleftrightarrow x=8/2=4.\]

  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Although this is a simple example, it highlights an important point about how algebra is rooted in the idea of manipulating known information about an unknown value to obtain, in a sense, new information. In fact, the name "algebra" was derived from a book written by the mathematician al-Khwārizmī (780-850) which included the term al-jabr in the title. In this work, al-Khwārizmī actually gave terms for specific powers of an unknown, such as shai' for \(x\), māl for \(x^2\), ka'b for \(x^3\), and so on (1). </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Common Criticisms of its Presentation as a Subject</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">It is no secret that algebra can draw the ire of students when they first encounter the subject. In fact, the jump in abstraction from other math courses is one of the key contributors to algebra having the title of being the <Strong>single most failed high school and community college course</Strong> (2). 
  </p>
    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    Even as a math major that has had some success in mathematics competitions (qualifying to the USA Math Olympiad as a sophomore in high school), I myself received a C in algebra in my first semester of the class as a sixth-grader. In truth, one of the most overlooked factors that determines whether or not a person is able to internalize a given mathematical concept is how the concept is motivated. At the time, I didn't retain the same passion for mathematics that I went on to have, which is certainly similar to an obstacle that many students of algebra face: they don't have a good reason to push themselves to learn more. According to one study published in the Universal Journal of Educational Research, one of the most common difficulties encountered by Year 6 students in an algebra class was even just being able to parse the meaning of the text in a question, with only 7.5% doing so with adequate proficiency (5).
    
</p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    As such, it is clear that many students end up having issues with gathering intuition about algebraic concepts, which can be a significant hindrance to their comprehension in later stages of mathematical learning. Yet, algebra as a course is often structured in such a way that emphasizes the memorization of common rules without conveying the underlying reasons for why they are formulated the way they are. 
    
    For instance, one commonly taught technique in algebra is the FOIL method, which is a manner in which one can compute the product of two binomials, such as \((a+b)\) and \((c+d)\). The result, according to the method, is given by taking the product of the first terms in the binomials, \(ac\), then the outside terms, \(ad\), then the inside terms \(bc\), and finally the outside terms \(bd\). Thus, one would be able to write that
    \[(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd.\]

However, the problem with teaching this approach is that, although it arrives at the correct answer, the reason it is correct is often left as a mystery to the student. Without any explanation, the student is left without the opportunity to make a valuable connection between concepts in algebra and is simply taught to apply an algorithm as a computer would, which ends up creating barriers in the learning process and even deprives students of their ability to think imaginatively (3, 4).
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Asking Natural Questions</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    So how do we reframe our presentation of algebra in such a way that students can gain an intuitive understanding of the ideas they are introduced to?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">One answer to this is to encourage them to consider natural questions with the prospect of inspiring curiosity and insight into the topics of algebra. Building on the previous example, one of the first questions that may come to mind for a student when learning the FOIL method might be, "What does this equation even mean?". While a such a question might be considered overly simple by some students, in that a they might tell themselves that they should already know the answer based on their prior knowledge, it is these kinds of questions that can guide them towards identifying how they can improve their conceptualization of a mathematical notion. </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In this case, the student might ultimately conclude that the equation is valid because plugging in any values for \(a, b, c, d\) maintains equality in the equation. But then, that leaves the question of why equality is maintained at all between such expressions. One idea that may come to mind is trying to show that the equality holds in a simpler scenario, such as when one variable, say \(d\) is \(0\). In plugging in \(d=0\), the student would find that they would like to show
    \[(a+b)\cdot c=ac+a\cdot 0+bc+b\cdot 0\]
    \[\Longleftrightarrow (a+b)\cdot c=ac+bc.\]
But upon inspection, the above equality is just equivalent to the distributive property of multiplication, so the student would know the identity must be true when \(d=0\). Feeling they are nearing a complete proof, the next natural question that might come to mind is "How much harder is it to show the equality when \(d\ne 0\)?". Well, how different are the two equalities from each other? The first has four variables and four terms on the right hand side, while the second has three variables and two terms on the right hand side. Could the terms be similar in any way?
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In fact, yes: \(ac+ad+bc+bd\) has \(ac+bc\) already included in the sum. The remaining part is \(ad+bd\), which ... has a very similar form - it is just the same expression with \(c\) replaced by \(d\). So if we group the terms, what we see is that by replacing these expressions by their equality in the distributive law, we just need to prove that
    \[(a+b)(c+d)=(a+b)\cdot c+(a+b)\cdot d.\]
At this point, the theme might become apparent: ask "Where does the distributive law come into play?". One more close look at the equation, and the student observes that the above equality is just the distributive law with the first term as \(a+b\). As such, through this process of asking natural questions, the student finally arrives at a conclusion for why the FOIL method works: it comes from a repeated application of the distributive law.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Although this was a somewhat rudimentary example, notice how the idea of applying the distributive property arose without the student expressly considering it initially. In a more general sense, by asking the proper questions, mathematics can actually begin to take on a life of its own, as was noted by the great Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann in his two-part essay, "The Mathematician" (6). While one might object that such a process of questioning is too straightforward to permit creative thinking, it actually allows the student to consider what is natural to them, which is precisely where the element of creativity comes into play.</p> 
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">In effect, the student has the choice of how to direct their learning so that they can best adapt to the content that is being presented in the classroom setting. Fostering such adaptability in the pedagogical methods applied to teaching algebra is just one way in which we can center the subject around the focus of exploration, rather than rote memorization.</p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    One additional benefit of this approach is that it can help to stray away from the stigma of algebra (and mathematics in general) only being tractable for those that have "higher" intellectual capacities. In this frame of mind, mathematics becomes more like storywriting, where the student is free to choose how they would like to experiment with any algebraic construct, which can even be aided by practical demonstrations of how one could model algebraic phenomena in real life (say, by creating a building by stacking different types of Legos).
