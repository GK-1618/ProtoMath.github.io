  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Mission</h1>
  <p style="width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i> One of ProtoMath's primary goals is to articulate the impact of a creative approach to mathematics education through providing ideas for synthesizing math concepts that facilitate a more active and enthusiastic learning experience for students. We believe that developing an atmosphere of interest and curiosity in mathematical settings can have numerous benefits, some of the most noteworthy of which are further elaborated on below. </i></p>

    Engagement With Mathematics
  </h3>

  </div>
  <p style="width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Encouraging the practice of engagement with mathematical topics in a classroom setting is an important way in which educators can foster a learning environment that advocates for more creative usages of the subject. It is important to note that students that maintain an interest in the presented topics often find more facility and ease with internalizing relevant concepts and are less susceptible to burnout, as pointed out in the 2023 article "The happy learner: Effects of academic boredom, burnout, and engagement." (1). Specifically, the authors of the paper found that "Boredom in mathematics was positively related to learner burnout and negatively related to learner engagement." (para. 25). This is a particularly stringent drawback of unmotivated modes of mathematical learning: they prevent students from finding individual incentive to explore the subject.  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    Eliminating Stigma

  <p style="width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> In many endeavors, there are often various stereotypes that are associated with both the people pursuing them as well as the characteristics of the areas themselves. Mathematics, in particular, is a subject that can have such aspects of stigma linked with it. As a field that is partially rooted in tasks of calculation, mathematics can receive the perception of simply taking on algorithmic tasks such as number crunching. Renato Pelessoni, an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Trieste, mentions how one of his students even had the impression that mathematicians generally looked a certain way and used all their time in computation (3). </p>
  <p style="width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    This is certainly not an isolated instance either. In a work titled "STEM Stereotypes and High School Students' Math/Science Career Goals", multiple studies were performed regarding internalized STEM stereotypes and how they affected general self-efficacy in such subjects (4). The results indicated a notable contribution to student interest in STEM-related pursuits from their perception of platitudes regarding those involved in such fields. In this manner, it is evident not only that such stigma can propogate a disadvantageous learning environment for students, but that it can also disadvantage learners themselves. We hope to mitigate such factors by fostering a more collaborative and inquisitive setting for students to engage in mathematics.
