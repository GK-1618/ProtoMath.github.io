  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">The origins of geometry as a subject date back to around 3000 BC, but the subject itself mainly began its progression around 700 BC, when the ancient Greeks first promoted the idea of utilizing certain mathematical techniques to obtain information about objects and shapes. In fact, the word "geometry" is derived from Greek etymology from the words "geo" (meaning "earth") and metria (meaning "measure"). Building on the works of the Egyptians and Babylonians, Greek geometers focused on extending the usage of algebra to contexts of measurement.</p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> The most renowned Greek geometer, commonly referred to as "The Father of Geometry", was Euclid, whose date of birth is approximated to be 330 BC. Euclid is perhaps most commonly known for his work on the Elements in developing an axiomatization of what is now referred to as Euclidean geometry. In addition to Euclid, some other famous Greek geometers include Thales, Pythagoras, Archimedes, and Appolonius.</p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">One of the main reasons that Euclidean geometry is the most widely seen form of geometry in the teaching of the subject relates to one particular postulate that was used in Euclid's axiomatization of Euclidean geometry, known as the Parallel Postulate. For a long time, geometers thought that there could be no geometry that satisfied all other axioms of Euclidean geometry without satisfying the Parallel Postulate, which is why Euclidean geometry was at the forefront of developments in the domain. However, in the 19th century, the mathematician Nikolay Ivanovich Lobachevsky discovered that there did exist such a geometry, which paved the way for a new field known as hyperbolic geometry. Although, nowadays, the direct study of geometry can be somewhat absent from higher mathematics, the subject continues to have notable applications in various fields of research.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Common Criticisms of its Presentation as a Subject</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    While geometry might not carry quite the same negative reputation as algebra, there are certainly some obstacles that students encounter that can give them a negative perception of the subject. Arguably the most significant such hurdle is the transition to a form of proof-based mathematics, which can serve as a significant impediment for students that aren't particularly familiar with how such forms of mathematical reasoning are structured. Part of this can be due to not being familiar with the conventions that determine what does or does not constitute a formal proof (3).
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    For example, a student might consider the statement that "a triangle with two equal interior angles has two sides of equal length" might seem to be trivially true on an initial glance. Still though, proofs of such statements typically require articulating any assumptions, even implicit, that are being made, so as to ensure that the line of logical reasoning is as explicit as possible. Although the student might see it as being overly-pedantic, formulating proofs in terms of an axiomatic system is an important component of mathematics that helps to give a sense of certainty to proven results. However, by introducing the formulation of proofs as a somewhat algorithmic procedure of translation, students can be removed from having an intrinsic understanding the real reason that mathematics uses the axiomatic system: to identify the structure of a relevant mathematical concept in a way that allows it to be studied.
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    In this sense, while the statement given previously might be 'intuitive', that in and of itself isn't sufficient to argue that it must be true. There are various mathematical statements that seem as though they couldn't possibly fail but actually have crucial counterexamples. One such claim is that the polynomial \(f(x)=x^2+x+41\) is prime for any positive integer \(x\). Just experimenting with small integer values, one might reach the conclusion that the statement couldn't possibly be false - the polynomial in question just seems to be structured in a way that is hard to reduce. After all, the polynomial is irreducible over the integers (it cannot be written as \((x+a)(x+b)\) for some integers \(a,b\)), and is actually prime for all integers from \(1\) up to \(39\). That can't just be a coincidence, right? 
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    Actually, it isn't quite a coincidence, but the claim really is false. While the polynomial is prime for any integer \(x\le 39\), it is composite when \(x=40\), as it produces the number \(41^2\). In fact, it turns out that any such integer polynomial cannot be prime on all inputs unless it is a (prime) constant (the same statement is true even if the polynomial is only prime for almost all natural number inputs). The reason that the polynomial satisfies this property, though, has to do with the fact the largest integer \(n\) such that the field \(\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-n})\) is a Unique Factorization Domain is \(n=163\), and that the discriminant of the polynomial is \(1-4\cdot 41=-163\). Of course, this is a theorem of Algebraic Number Theory which isn't an elementary field of mathematics, but it does highlight a key point about proofs which is that we have them because mathematics can sometimes be deceptive. This is one reason that changing the current method of introducing mathematical proofs to include examples of statements that don't succumb to them could be beneficial: it would help to motivate the process of constructing such lines of reasoning. 
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Describing the Real World</h2>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    One unique feature of geometry that can be less evident in many other subjects of mathematics is that it has relatively natural applications to real-world problems. As opposed to algebra, which can work with ideas such as partial fraction decomposition that might have no physical interpretation, the applications that geometry can have in contexts such as engineering makes it so that some individuals can relate more with the content that is being taught. Learning, say, the Pythagorean theorem can be more interesting when you have the opportunity to apply it to determine the shortest path a robot you are building needs to take to e.g. visit four different points. This touches upon a point that mathematics is often praised but also even a bit criticized for: it has numerous applications to real-world ventures. 
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    Certainly, the applications of mathematics to such real-world ventures are typically viewed in a positive light, as they have historically allowed for important advances in areas such as cryptography and microeconomics. But the other side of the coin is that mathematics is structured to be somewhat independent of advances in other disciplines, which can bring up the question of whether or not mathematics is being developed to its maximum utility. 
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    And in all likelihood, the answer to that question is that it usually isn't being optimized to have real-world relevance, mainly because mathematicians most often study what they find to be interesting or elegant. While some mathematicians, generally applied, do focus specifically on doing mathematics that is suited for applications to practical situations, the majority are motivated by a creative connection with their work. In particular, mathematicians as a whole have a sort of broad understanding of the factors that constitute "good" mathematics, many of which are subjective criteria. But overall, most mathematicians have a similar view of what "good" mathematics is, which maintains the core characteristic of being mathematics that has utility within the subject itself (4). 
  </p>
  <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    While there might be varying philosophies of how mathematics should be done in this sense, geometry helps to serve the important purpose of informing students about such philosophies by exposing them to new contexts in which mathematics can be utilized, which makes it all the more important that the subject is taught with care for how those contexts are presented.
